  "D. Java uses the suffix f to indicate a number is a float. Java automatically widens a type, allowing a float to be assigned to either a float or a double. This makes both lines p1 and p3 compile. Line p2 does compile without a suffix. Line p4 does not compile without a suffix and therefore is the answer.",
  "A. A byte is smaller than a char, making Option C incorrect. bigint is not a primitive, making Option D incorrect. A double uses twice as much memory as a float variable, therefore Option A is correct.",
  "D. The instance variables, constructor, and method names can appear in any order within a class declaration.",
  "B. Java does not allow multiple Java data types to be declared in the same declaration, making Option B the correct answer. If double was removed, both hot and cold would be the same type. Then the compiler error would be on x3 because of a reference to an uninitialized variable.",
  "C. Lines 2 and 7 illustrate instance initializers. Line 6 is a static initializer. Lines 3â€“5 are a constructor.",
  "A. Since defaultValue is a local variable, it is not automatically initialized. That means the code will not compile with any type. Therefore, Option A is correct. If this was an instance variable, Option C would be correct as int and short would be initialized to 0 while double would be initialized to 0.0.",
  "A. The finalize() method may not be called, such as if your program crashes. However, it is guaranteed to be called no more than once.",
  "D. String is a class, but it is not a wrapper class. In order to be a wrapper class, the class must have a one-to-one mapping with a primitive.",
  "C. Lines 15â€“17 create the three objects. Lines 18â€“19 change the references so link2 and link3 point to each other. The lines 20â€“21 wipe out two of the original references. This means the object with name as x is inaccessible.",
  "C. Options A and D are incorrect because byte and short do not store values with decimal points. Option B is tempting. However, 3.14 is automatically a double. It requires casting to float or writing 3.14f in order to be assigned to a float. Therefore, Option C is correct.",
  "B. Integer is the name of a class in Java. While it is bad practice to use the name of a class as your local variable name, this is legal. Therefore, k1 does compile. It is not legal to use a reserved word as a variable name. All of the primitives including int are reserved words. Therefore, k2 does not compile, and Option B is the answer. Line k4 doesnâ€™t compile either, but the question asks about the first line to not compile.",
  "B. Dot notation is used for both reading and writing instance variables, assuming they are in scope. It cannot be used for referencing local variables, making Option B the correct answer.",
  "C. Class names follow the same requirements as other identifiers. Underscores and dollar signs are allowed. Numbers are allowed, but not as the first character of an identifier. Therefore, Option C is correct. Note that class names begin with an uppercase letter by convention, but this is not a requirement.",
  "D. This question is tricky as it appears to be about primitive vs. wrapper classes. Looking closely, there is an underscore right before the decimal point. This is illegal as the underscore in a numeric literal can only appear between two digits.",
  "C. Local variables do not have a default initialization value. If they are referenced before being set to a value, the code does not compile. Therefore, Option C is correct. If the variable was an instance variable, Option B would be correct. Option D is tricky. A local variable will compile without an initialization if it isnâ€™t referenced anywhere or it is assigned a value before it is referenced.",
  "C. Since defaultValue is an instance variable, it is automatically initialized to the corresponding value for that type. For double, that value is 0.0. By contrast, it is 0 for int, long, and short. Therefore Option C is correct.",
  "B. Option B is an example of autoboxing. Java will automatically convert from primitive to wrapper class types and vice versa. Option A is incorrect because you can only call methods on an object. Option C is incorrect because this method is used for converting to a wrapper class from a String. Option D is incorrect because autoboxing will convert the primitive to an object before adding it to the ArrayList.",
  "C. Java does not allow calling a method on a primitive. While autoboxing does allow the assignment of an Integer to an int, it does not allow calling an instance method on a primitive. Therefore, the last line does not compile.",
  "D. In order to call a constructor, you must use the new keyword. It cannot be called as if it was a normal method. This rules out Options A and B. Further, Option C is incorrect because the parentheses are required.",
  "A. Option A (I) correctly assigns the value to both variables. II does not compile as dog does not have a type. Notice the semicolon in that line, which starts a new statement. III compiles but only assigns the value to dog since a declaration only assigns to one variable rather than everything in the declaration. IV does not compile because the type should only be specified once per declaration.",
  "C. The wrapper class for int is Integer and the wrapper class for char is Character. All other primitives have the same name. For example, the wrapper class for boolean is Boolean.",
  "A. Assuming the variables are not primitives, they allow a null assignment. The other statements are false.",
  "A. An example of a primitive type is int. All the primitive types are lowercase, making Option A correct. Unlike object reference variables, primitives cannot reference null. String is not a primitive as evidenced by the uppercase letter in the name and the fact that we can call methods on it. You can create your own classes, but not primitives.",
  "D. While you can suggest to the JVM that it might want to run a garbage collection cycle, the JVM is free to ignore your suggestion. Option B is how to make this suggestion. Since garbage collection is not guaranteed to run, Option D is correct.",
  "C. All three references point to the String apple. This makes the other two String objects eligible for garbage collection and Option C correct.",
  "B. A constructor can only be called with a class name rather than a primitive, making Options A and C incorrect. The newly constructed Double object can be assigned to either a double or Double thanks to autoboxing. Therefore, Option B is correct.",
  "B. First line 2 runs and sets the variable using the declaration. Then the instance initializer on line 6 runs. Finally, the constructor runs. Since the constructor is the last to run of the three, that is the value that is set when we print the result, so Option B is correct.",
  "C. Objects are allowed to have a null reference while primitives cannot. int is a primitive, so assigning null to it does not compile. Integer and String are both objects and can therefore be assigned a null reference. Therefore, Option C is correct.",
  "C. An instance variable can only be referenced from instance methods in the class. A static variable can be referenced from any method. Therefore, Option C is correct.",
  "B. Underscores are allowed between any two digits in a numeric literal. Underscores are not allowed adjacent to a decimal point, making Option B the correct answer.",
  "A. These four types represent nondecimal values. While you donâ€™t need to know the exact sizes, you do need to be able to order them from largest to smallest. A byte is smallest. A short comes next, followed by int and then long. Therefore, Option A is correct.",
  "A. Java uses dot notation to reference instance variables in a class, making Option A correct.",
  "B. If there was a finalize() method, this would be a different story. However, the method here is finalizer. Tricky! Thatâ€™s just a normal method that doesnâ€™t get called automatically. Therefore clean is never output.",
  "A. Options B and C do not compile. In Java, braces are for arrays rather than instance variables. Option A is the correct answer. It uses dot notation to access the instance variable. It also shows that a private variable is accessible in the same class and that a narrower type is allowed to be assigned to a wider type.",
  "B. The parseInt() methods return a primitive. The valueOf() methods return a wrapper class object. In real code, autoboxing would let you assign the return value to either a primitive or wrapper class. In terms of what gets returned directly, Option B is correct.",
  "B. On line 9, all three objects have references. The elena and zoe objects have a direct reference. The diana object is referenced through the elena object. On line 10, the reference to the diana object is replaced by a reference to the zoe object. Therefore, the diana object is eligible to be garbage collected, and Option B is correct.",
  "C. Options A and B are static methods rather than constructors. Option D is a method that happens to have the same name as the class. It is not a constructor because constructors donâ€™t have return types.",
  "A. Remember that garbage collection is not guaranteed to run on demand. If it doesnâ€™t run at all, Option B would be output. If it runs at the requested point, Option C would be output. If it runs right at the end of the main() method, Option D would be output. Option A is the correct answer because play is definitely called twice. Note that you are unlikely to see all these scenarios if you run this code because we have not used enough memory for garbage collection to be worth running. However, you still need to be able to answer what could happen regardless of it being unlikely.",
  "B. Each wrapper class has a constructor that takes the primitive equivalent. The methods mentioned in Options A, C, and D do not exist.",
  "C. The main() method calls the constructor which outputs a. Then the main method calls the run() method. The run() method calls the constructor again, which outputs a again. Then the run() method calls the Sand() method, which happens to have the same name as the constructor. This outputs b. Therefore, Option C is correct."
